/*

Callbacks in JavaScript are functions that are passed as arguments to other
functions. This is a very important feature of asynchronous programming, and it
enables the function that receives the callback to call our code when it
finishes a long task, while allowing us to continue the execution of the code.


EXAMPLE 1
---------
Below we have a sayHello function. We can use the built in setTimeout method to
run sayHello after a delay. In this case, 'sayHello' is our callback.

*/

const sayHello = () => {
  console.log('Hello!')
}

// Run sayHello after a two second delay.
setTimeout(sayHello, 2000);


/*

EXAMPLE 2
---------
When you use forEach, you're actually using a callback, you just don't usually
give it a name. This is called an anonymous function.

*/

const names = ['Jane', 'John', 'Jack']

names.forEach((name) => {
  // I'm a function, too ðŸ˜¢
  // #anonymousFunctionsAreFunctionsToo #neverForget #whadaYaMeanWhadaYaMean
  console.log(name)
})


/*

EXAMPLE 3
---------
Here's the exact same thing but this time we give our callback a name.
Anonymous no more, my friend.

*/

const printName = (name) => {
  console.log(name)
}

names.forEach(printName)

CHALLENGE
---------

https://gist.github.com/scottdixon/ce988c99b67ddd9f7678cca7be89828c

Line 13 is calling 'sayGreetings' and handing it a callback 'sayNiceToMeetYou'
Line 14 is calling 'sayGreetings' and handing it a callback 'sayGoodbye'

Fix the 'sayGreetings' function so it runs the callback each time.

DESIRED OUTPUT:
Greetings!
Nice to meet you!
Greetings!
Goodbye!
