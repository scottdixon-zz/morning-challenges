# Prep for interviews: Don't Google (yeah, I said it).
# Whiteboard first. You don't need to know perfect syntax.
# Having a rough idea on how to approach the problem is just
# as good in an interview.

# Exes and Ohs
#
# Check to see if a string has the same amount
# of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean
# and be case insensitive.
#
# Examples:
# ExesAndOhs("ooxx") => true
# ExesAndOhs("xooxx") => false
# ExesAndOhs("sxoowxxoq") => true
# ExesAndOhs("oOxXxoXo") => true
# ExesAndOhs("oOxXxoX") => false
# ExesAndOhs("zpzpzpp") => true
#
# Check your answers by running the tests:
# ruby tests/15_exes_and_ohs_test.rb
#

def ExesAndOhs(string)
  # yo' co' here
