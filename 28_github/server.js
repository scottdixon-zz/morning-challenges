  GitHub API

  Our express app is hitting the GitHub API and returning information
  about a user.

  * Don't run the server until step 3 *

  1. Check out the GitHub API response of:
     https://api.github.com/users/[your-user-name]

  2. Look at the code below and think about what it's doing.

  3. Start the server and head to:
     http://localhost:3000/github/[your-github-username]
     You'll see we're listing the user's username

  4. List more information in the view (location, total repos, etc)

  5. Beast mode: Can you list each of the users repos in the view?
     (hint: https://api.github.com/users/<github-user>/repos)
