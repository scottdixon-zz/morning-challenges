  After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation.

  You will need a rental car in order for you to get around.
  The manager of the car rental company makes you some good offers.

  Every day that you rent the car costs $40.
  If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total.
  Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

  Write a function that returns the total cost for (d) days.

  Examples:
  rentalCarCost(1) -> 40
  rentalCarCost(2) -> 80
  rentalCarCost(3) -> 100

function rentalCarCost (d) {
  let total = 0;
  // Your code here!

  return total
}

// Leave this line intact
module.exports = rentalCarCost;
