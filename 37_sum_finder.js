/*
  Sum finder

  This function takes two arguments:
  numbers (an array of integers) and sum (an integer).

  Return true if any two numbers in the array can be added together to
  equal sum. Otherwise return false.

  For example:
  sumFinder([1,1], 2) -> true (1 and 1 = 2)
  sumFinder([1,3], 2) -> false (no two numbers sum to 2)
  sumFinder([1,8,9,5], 6) -> true (5 and 1 = 6)

  Tests: mocha tests/37_sum_finder_test.js

  Beast mode:
  - What is the time complexity of your algorithm?
  - Get your algorithm working with strings and integers ([1,"2",3,"4"])
  - Strip non-numbers from the array first. E.g. keep 3 and "3" but remove "a"
