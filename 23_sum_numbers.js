/*
  Sum Numbers

  Write a method that will take an array of numbers,
  and return their sum.

  JS syntax will be the hardest part. Goodluck!

  Example:
  sumNumbers([1,1,1]) should return 3
  sumNumbers([5,2,100,0,10]) should return 117
  sumNumbers([1]) should return 1

  Check your solution by running the tests:
  mocha tests/23_sum_numbers_test.js
*/

sumNumbers = (numbers) => {
  
}
  
// Don't remove this line, the tests need it
module.exports = sumNumbers
