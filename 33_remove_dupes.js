  Remove Dupes TDD

  This is a TDD challenge. Write the tests first.

  Try doing this without Googling!
  Use a .forEach loop and .includes to solve the problem.
  
  Syntax help: [1,2,3].includes(1) -> true, [1,2,3].includes(4) -> false

  removeDupes should take an array of strings, remove duplicates and return a new array.
  
  1. There's an empty test file in `/tests`. Reference other JS tests to get started.
  2. Write some tests for removeDupes. They should fail.
  3. Implement removeDupes, run your tests to check they pass.

  Beast mode:

  1. Following TDD, update removeDupes to work for numbers too.
  E.g. "1" and 1 should be treated as different values.

// Export removeDupes so we can test it!
